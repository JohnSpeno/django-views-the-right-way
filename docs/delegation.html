<h1>Custom logic at the start — delegation<a class="headerlink" href="#custom-logic-at-the-start-delegation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>The next few pages address the problem of needing to re-use some logic from one
view in another view. We’ve thought about how we can use utility functions and
classes, but sometimes these don’t cut it — sometimes the majority of the body
of the view needs to be re-used. How can we do that with FBVs?</p>
<p>Continuing our <a class="reference internal" href="list_view.html"><span class="doc">example</span></a> of a list of products, let’s add a
variation. As well as the main product list page, we’ve also got a “special
offers” page — or rather, a set of them, because we can have a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">SpecialOffer</span></code>
model that allows us to have many different ones. Each of these pages needs to
display some details about the special offer, and then the list of products
associated with that offer. Our feature requirements say this product list
should have <strong>all</strong> the features of the normal product list (filtering, sorting
etc.), so we want to re-use the logic as much as possible.</p>
<p>So our view will need to do two things: it will show a single object, and also
shows a list. The answer of how to do two things with FBVs is: <strong>do two
things</strong>: No special tricks needed for that. Let’s start with a simple version
of our view:</p>

</div>
<p>I’ve assumed the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">SpecialOffer.get_products()</span></code> method exists and returns a
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">QuerySet</span></code>. If you have an appropriate <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ManyToMany</span></code> relationships the
implementation might be as simple as <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">return</span> <span class="pre">self.products.all()</span></code>, but it
might be different.</p>
<p>But now we want to change this view to re-use the logic in our normal
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">product_list</span></code> view, whether it is filtering/sorting/paging or anything else
it has built up by now. How should we do that?</p>
<p>The simplest way is to look at our old <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">product_list</span></code> view and apply
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.toptal.com/python/python-parameterized-design-patterns">parameterisation</a>. The
parameters we need to pass are: the product list <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">QuerySet</span></code>; the name of the
template to use; and something to pass in some extra context. With those in
place we can easily pull out a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">display_product_list</span></code> function, and call it
from our two functions. I’m calling this pattern <strong>delegation</strong> — our entry
point view is delegating the rest of the work to another function.</p>

<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>For those unfamiliar with the signature on <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">display_product_list</span></code>, here
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">queryset</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">template_name</span></code> are “keyword only” arguments (lacking
defaults, because we don’t have any good defaults), because we want to ensure
that people will pass them by name for clarity. For <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">context</span></code> we do have a
sensible default, but also need to avoid the mutable arguments bug.</p>
</div>
<p>At the template level, we’ll probably do a similar refactoring, using <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/ref/templates/builtins/#include">include</a> to
factor out duplication.</p>
<p>That’s it! See below for some more discussion about how this delegation pattern

<span id="function-based-generic-views"></span><h2>Discussion: Function based generic views<a class="headerlink" href="#discussion-function-based-generic-views" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>What happens if you keep going with this parameterisation pattern? Let’s say you
have not one model, but lots of models where you want to display a list, with
the same kind of filtering/sorting/paging logic applied?</p>
<p>You might end up with an <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">object_list</span></code> function and a bunch of parameters,
instead of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">product_list</span></code>. In other words, you’ll end up with your own
function based generic views, <a class="reference external" href="https://django.readthedocs.io/en/1.3.X/topics/generic-views.html#generic-views-of-objects">just like the ones that used to exist in Django</a>.</p>
<p>Isn’t that a step backwards? I’d argue no. With the benefit of hindsight, I’d
argue that the move from these function based generic views to class based
generic views was actually the backwards step.</p>
<p>But that is in the past. Looking forward, the generic <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">object_list</span></code> you might
develop will be better than both Django’s old generic FBVs and the newer generic
CBVs in several ways:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>They will have all the functionality you need built-in.</p></li>
<li><p>Importantly, they will have none of the functionality you don’t need.</p></li>
<li><p>You will be able to change them <strong>whenever you want</strong>, <strong>however you want</strong>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In other words, they will be both specific (to your project) and generic (across
your project) in all the right ways. They won’t suffer from Django’s limitations
in trying to be all things to all men.</p>
<p>As FBVs they will probably be better for you than your own custom CBVs:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>They will have a well defined interface, which is visible right there in the
function signature, which is great for usability.</p></li>
<li><p>The generic code will be properly separated from the specific. For example,
inside your <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">object_list</span></code> function, local variable names will be very
generic, but these won’t bleed out into functions that might call
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">object_list</span></code>, because you don’t inherit local variable names (in contrast
to classes where you do inherit instance variable names).</p></li>
<li><p>At some point you might find you have too many parameters to a function. But
this is a good thing. For your class-based equivalent, the number of extension
points would be the same, but hidden from you in the form of lots of mixins
each with their own attributes and methods. With the function, your problem is
more visible, and can prompt you factor things out. For example, if you have
several parameters related to filtering a list, perhaps you actually need a
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Filterer</span></code>?</p></li>

<h2>Discussion: Copy-paste Programming Bad, Classes Good?<a class="headerlink" href="#discussion-copy-paste-programming-bad-classes-good" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Where do Django’s generic CBVs come from? Why didn’t we stop with function based
generic views? The problem was that there was an endless list of requests to
extend generic views to do one more thing, and we wanted to provide something
more customisable.</p>
<p>Our answer to this problem ought to have been this: if these generic views don’t
do what you want, write your own. You can easily copy-paste the functionality
you need and start from there. So why didn’t we just say that? I think we
somehow had the idea that copy-paste is the ultimate disaster in software
development. If there is some functionality written, we should always make it
re-usable rather than re-implement, and we’ve somehow failed as software
developers if we can’t.</p>
<p>You can see this in the design of the CBVs. A lot of the complexity in the
hierarchy looks like it was introduced in order to avoid a single duplicate
line. <a class="reference external" href="https://verraes.net/2014/08/dry-is-about-knowledge/">But that shouldn’t be our primary aim</a>.</p>
<p>There are plenty of things worse than copy-paste programming, and unhelpful
abstractions are among them.</p>
<p>I recently wrote several implementations of Mozilla’s <a class="reference external" href="https://projectfluent.org/">Fluent</a> localisation language, all of them in Python. One
of them was a Fluent-to-Python compiler, another was a Fluent-to-Elm compiler.
These two projects are clearly very similar in nature. So when I started the
second, I did so with <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/elm-fluent/elm-fluent/commit/a100de2021dcc4fa413769342b1cba0240ba63ee">one big copy-paste job</a>.
I knew that although there were many, many similarities between the two
projects, there would also be many, many differences. I was right — the two code
bases still share a huge amount in terms of structure. In a few places they even
still have significant chunks of identical code. But the code bases have also
diverged at many, many points, both in small details and in more fundamental
ways.</p>
<p>The decision to copy-paste was overwhelming the right decision. Attempting to
avoid duplicating anything while I was developing the second would have been an
absolute killer in terms of complexity, and may have failed completely. Once or
twice I copied fixes or changes directly from one to the other, but most times
when I had “equivalent” changes to do, they looked significantly different in
the two projects. Having to do them twice from scratch cost far, far less than
attempting to write the two projects with a common abstraction layer.</p>
<p>Before you can abstract commonality, you actually need at least two examples,
preferably three, and abstracting before then is premature. The commonalities
may be very different from what you thought, and when you have enough
information to make that decision you might decide that it’s not worth it. So
avoiding all duplication at any cost is not the aim we should have.</p>

<div class="section" id="discussion-multiple-mixins">
<h2>Discussion: Multiple mixins?<a class="headerlink" href="#discussion-multiple-mixins" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>When doing both a single object lookup and a list of objects, contrast the
simplicity of the above FBV code with <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/class-based-views/mixins/#using-singleobjectmixin-with-listview">trying to wrangle CBVs into doing this</a>.
These Django docs do come up with a solution for this case, but it is a house of
cards that requires lots of extremely careful thinking and knowing the
implementation as well as interface of all the mixins involved.</p>
<p>Thankfully the docs do add a “don’t try this at home kids” warning and mention
that many mixins don’t actually work together. But we need to add to those
warnings:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>It’s virtually impossible to know ahead of time which combinations are likely
to turn out bad. It’s pretty much the point of mixins that you can “mix and
match” behaviour. Except it turns out you can’t.</p></li>
<li><p>Simple things often turn into complicated things. If you have started with
CBVs, you will most likely want to continue, and you’ll find yourself rather
snarled up. You will then have to retrace, and completely restructure your
code, working out how to implement for yourself the things the CBVs were doing
for you. As we mentioned before, the CBV is a <a class="reference internal" href="thepattern.html#bad-starting-point"><span class="std std-ref">bad starting point</span></a>.</p></li>
